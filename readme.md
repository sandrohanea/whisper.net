# Whisper.net
Open-Source Whisper.net

Dotnet bindings for OpenAI Whisper made possible by [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)

	
## Getting started

To install Whisper.net, run the following command in the [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console):

    PM> Install-Package Whisper.net
    PM> Install-Package Whisper.net.Runtime

or simply add a package reference in your csproj:

```
    <PackageReference Include="Whisper.net" Version="1.4.3" />
    <PackageReference Include="Whisper.net.Runtime" Version="1.4.3" />
```

## Runtime

The runtime package, Whisper.net.Runtime, contains the native whisper.cpp library and it is required in order to run Whisper.net.

## Versioning

Each version of Whisper.net is tied to a specific version of Whisper.cpp. The version of Whisper.net is the same as the version of Whisper it is based on. For example, Whisper.net 1.2.0 is based on Whisper 1.2.0.

However, there can be cases where Whisper.net patch version is incremented without a corresponding Whisper.cpp version change. This is the case when the changes in Whisper.net are not related to the changes in Whisper.cpp.

## Ggml Models

Whisper.net uses Ggml models to perform speech recognition and translation.

You can find more about Ggml models [here](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/models)

Also, for easier integration Whisper.net provides a Downloader which is using https://huggingface.co.

```csharp

    var modelName = "ggml-base.bin";
    if (!File.Exists(modelName))
    {
        using var modelStream = await WhisperGgmlDownloader.GetGgmlModelAsync(GgmlType.Base);
        using var fileWriter = File.OpenWrite(modelName);
        await modelStream.CopyToAsync(fileWriter);
    }

```

## Usage

```csharp

    using var whisperFactory = WhisperFactory.FromPath("ggml-base.bin");

    using var processor = whisperFactory.CreateBuilder()
        .WithLanguage("auto")
        .Build();

    using var fileStream = File.OpenRead(wavFileName);

    await foreach(var result in processor.ProcessAsync(fileStream))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{result.Start}->{result.End}: {result.Text}");
    }
```

## Documentation

## Building The Runtime

The build scripts are a combination of PowerShell scripts and a Makefile. You can read each of them for the underlying `cmake` commands being used, or run them directly from the scripts.

### Android:

`make android`

- Before running, create an environment variable for `NDK_PATH` with the path to your Android NDK. For example,

`NDK_PATH=/Users/UserName/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx/ndk-bundle`

### Apple:

`make apple`

or

`pwsh ./scripts/build-osx.ps1`

- Compiling the Apple libraries requires a Mac with Xcode installed.

### Linux:

`make linux`

or

`pwsh ./scripts/build-linux.ps1`

### Windows:

- Run the `.bat` files in the root of this repo, or the powershell `./script/build-windows.ps1`
